Expenditure

I'm still very confused about money management because so far she has never been away from home and her parents. For this reason, Mutiara had the idea to create an application for recording her expenses. Help Mutiara to make her expense/financial recording application.

Make a disbursement record with the following specifications: 1. The application can enter the name, day, month, and money spent.

2. The application can calculate Pearl expenses for one day or month or one year.

3. The application can search for expenses by year, month, day.
